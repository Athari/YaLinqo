# Security reports

If you find a security issue in the code of YaLinqo, you should first consider:

1. Reporting it to the developers of PHP. The code of the library uses only the basic features of PHP, with zero dependencies. If it causes an actual security issue, the problem is with PHP.

    For details on reporting a PHP security issue, see [PHP > Security](https://wiki.php.net/security) page.

2. Talking to your psychiatrist.

    For details, see [Google > closest psychiatrist to my location](https://www.google.com/search?q=closest+psychiatrist+to+my+location).

3. If you still have nobody to talk to, feel free [file a private security report](https://github.com/Athari/YaLinqo/security/advisories/new).

    Issues submitted via this form will only be accessible to you and the developer of YaLinqo.
