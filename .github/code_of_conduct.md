# Code of conduct

## TL;DR
Be blunt. Be right. Be useful. Don’t be a threat, doxx, or discriminate. If you can’t handle feedback, go take a nap and come back with a better PR.

## Our pledge
We value technical rigor, clear signals, and honest feedback. We prefer sarcasm to sugarcoating.

## What’s good
- **Signal > noise.** Useful critiques, concrete fixes, and reproducible bugs get respect.
- **Directness.** Call out bugs and bad design — cite examples, provide tests, propose patches.
- **No crybabies.** If someone says you’re wrong, check the facts. If they’re right, say “you were right” and move on.
- **Rank = code quality.** Critique anyone’s code; don’t attack who they are.

## What’s bad
Death threats, doxxing, discrimination, bigoted remarks and slurs.

## Reporting
1. Call out the behavior on the thread so it’s visible.
2. Pray to your gods that somebody notices.

Enforcement ladder:
1. Stern look.
2. Slap on the wrist.
3. Callout to stop in all caps.
4. Temporary ban.

## Legal stuff
We will report credible threats or doxxing to authorities. Don’t test this.
