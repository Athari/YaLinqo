     * <p>Three methods are defined to extend the type OrderedEnumerable, which is the return type of this method. These three methods, namely {@link thenBy}, {@link thenByDescending} and {@link thenByDir}, enable you to specify additional sort criteria to sort a sequence. These methods also return an OrderedEnumerable, which means any number of consecutive calls to thenBy, thenByDescending or thenByDir can be made.
     * <p>Because OrderedEnumerable inherits from {@link Enumerable}, you can call {@link Enumerable::orderBy orderBy}, {@link Enumerable::orderByDescending orderByDescending} or {@link Enumerable::orderByDir orderByDir} on the results of a call to orderBy, orderByDescending, orderByDir, thenBy, thenByDescending or thenByDir. Doing this introduces a new primary ordering that ignores the previously established ordering.
     * <p>This method performs an unstable sort; that is, if the keys of two elements are equal, the order of the elements is not preserved. In contrast, a stable sort preserves the order of elements that have the same key. Internally, {@link usort} is used.
